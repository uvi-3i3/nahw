# Project: Quranic Nahw RPG - The City of Language

This file serves as a central hub for the development of the Quranic Nahw RPG.

## Project Overview

As detailed in the design document, this project is an educational RPG designed to teach Quranic Arabic grammar (Nahw) in an interactive and engaging way.

## Next Steps

1.  **Project Scaffolding:** Create the basic folder structure for the project.
    ```
    /
    |-- docs/
    |   |-- design_document.md
    |-- src/
    |   |-- css/
    |   |-- js/
    |   |-- index.html
    |-- assets/
    |   |-- images/
    |   |-- audio/
    |-- data/
    |   |-- quranic_content.json
    ```
2.  **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript. A framework like **React** or **Vue.js** is recommended for managing the UI components.
    *   **Content:** The Quranic content and grammatical data will be stored in JSON files for easy access.

3.  **MVP Development Plan:**
    *   **Phase 1 (Current Focus):**
        *   Implement the Prologue: The Seeker's Arrival.
        *   Develop the diagnostic test mechanic.
        *   Build the basic UI for displaying text and choices.
    *   **Phase 2:**
        *   Implement Chapter 1: The Paths of Intention.
        *   Develop the core gameplay loop of identifying and marking grammatical features.
    *   **Phase 3:**
        *   Build out the remaining chapters and features as outlined in the design document.

## Open Questions

*   What specific JavaScript framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) will be used?
